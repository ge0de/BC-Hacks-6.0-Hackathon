# The Solo Warrior
* ge0de

## Inspiration
Unconventional, Avant-Garde Originality.
## What it does
It's a banking website. Not really. It's got a bunch of easter eggs and trolls. Have fun.
## How I built it
All-nighters on VSCode working on JS, HTML, CSS.
## Challenges I ran into
Keeping the willpower up while coding until 6 AM.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Nothing has been accomplished yet. The awards await.<br>
**Update: This abomination won the "Best On-Theme Hack".**
## What I learned
Discipline, Sacrifice, Willpower.
## What's next for Ge0de's Online Banking
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
